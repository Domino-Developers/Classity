Lets first start with the presentation

So we all know that today students prefer learning online. Also, in this time of the ongoing pandemic, this is going to increase further.

--------------------------------------------------------

Here are some features of some current famous study platforms. All platforms have some flaws. 

---------------------------------------------------------

None of them are perfect, let's take positive points of all and mix them

----------------------------------------------------------

Inspired by YouTube teachers we present you, CLASSITY

----------------------------------------------------------

Classity is a study platform where instructors can create interactive courses easily paid or free. It has been created by keeping in mind the mindset of an instructor and a student. Things like motivation and rewards are deeply rooted inside the platform.

------------------------------------------------------------

The basic features are a blend of all positive features that other platforms have. Content-rich courses can be created easily. Students are encouraged through deadlines and certificate on completion.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Still not much difference?
Well, Classity is much more than what we said till now. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------

A Good quality platform requires a motivated community, which in turn requires them to be awarded. Just like websites Stackoverflow and Quora motivate you to write answers for free, we also do it here. Creating good quality courses awards contribution points to prove their worth. 
Score gained by studying and doing tests helps in inducing competition.
Remember playing games having limited energy? We have that too
We know that a student can't focus on many subjects at the same time and therefore we make things more exciting and efficient by giving energy to students. Each course enrollment requires energy

---------------------------------------------------------------

Next, these are our plans regarding infrastructure.
Features like google login, desktop/mobile apps, and responsive web app are coming soon. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Lets now move on to the business and sustainability aspect of classity.


--------------------------------------------------------------

We need to get customers, keep them and grow
We plan to target quality instructors having less audience first. We will get a boost if we manage to raise funds by donation or prize money.
We will make sure that our platform has all the latest features and will take all customers suggestion or criticism seriously to keep customers
Fortunately, given the nature of the platform, growing customers seem not to be much of an issue. As instructor will attract more students and in turn, students will attract more instructors

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now lets come to finances. We can see that the expenses are quite less. For the income part, We will take only a 10% commission on paid courses, which would be enough for starting. Alse, we can earn through advertising.

--------------------------------------------------------------

We have planed these three stages of evolution until now. For the first 2 stages, we will invest. And from the third stage, classity will be able to make good profit. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

So all of this is our plan till now.  But still, it's just a hypothesis and things will change when we take our product out of the building.
We are inspired enough to change and grow ourselves in the process of building this a successful game changer startup.

That all for the presentation, lets quickly jump into demo of Classity. My friend Sanchit will take on from here. Thank you everyone !
